# T3 Tailwind Radix

This is an app template started from [T3 Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) with [tailwindcss-radix](https://github.com/ecklf/tailwindcss-radix) and a nice [tailwind styled component helper](https://github.com/JackRKelly/t3-tailwind-radix/blob/master/utils/tw.ts) made by [Brendan](https://github.com/Brendonovich) for [spacedrive](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive).

Technologies used:

- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TailwindCSS-Radix](https://github.com/ecklf/tailwindcss-radix)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

## Motivation

T3 Stack, Radix, and tailwindcss-radix all help reduce the time it takes to start a project. But there is still a lot of foundational work to do, such as: define props and implement animations for radix components, create non-radix primitive components, define a highly customizable theme via css variables, etc. This template aims to provide a stronger foundation for building apps with these technologies.
